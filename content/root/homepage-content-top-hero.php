              CryptoKlout.com is a free social platform that allows users and robots make predictions on where they see Bitcoin going in the near future. The predictions are then transformed into aggregated "trends" that only contributors can access.

            <h1>Are you the Crypto Oracle?</h1>
            <p class="hero-text">Contributor predictions are tracked over time and individual predictions can be referenced for proof via embeded url. Predictors are ranked based on their success over time. Predictors with true talent are eventually promoted to rank "Oracle". Do you have what it takes to rise to the top of the Crypto world?
